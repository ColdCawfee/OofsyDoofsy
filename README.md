# OofsyDoofsy
A better, revamped and much cleaner version of my old, now deleted "Pyoof" repo.

## This repo now has no more easygui (Because of easygui needing c++), and now uses a prebuilt one, plus only one library (psutil) (why didn't I think of this sooner?)

### To run, literally just download this repo and run ```oofsyDoofsy.py```.

#### More updates are planned, like for non-ogg files to be converted to .ogg

#### The name OofsyDoofsy is derived from the common phrase "Oopsy Doopsy!", because of me deleting the source code off my laptop twice ._.
